# YOLOv8 Architecture

- **Backbone**:
  Used to extract useful features from images. Utilizes a series of convolutional layers, C2f blocks, and SPPF (Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast) layers to create a rich feature representation.

- **Neck**:
  Processes the features from the backbone and prepares them for the head. It includes additional C2f blocks to refine the feature maps.

- **Head**:
  Makes the final predictions based on the processed features from the neck. It outputs three sets of predictions corresponding to different scales (P3, P4, P5).

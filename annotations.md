# YOLOv8 Architecture

- **Backbone**:
  Used to extract useful features from images. Utilizes a series of convolutional layers, C2f blocks, and SPPF (Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast) layers to create a rich feature representation.

- **Neck**:
  Processes the features from the backbone and prepares them for the head. It includes additional C2f blocks to refine the feature maps.

- **Head**:
  Makes the final predictions based on the processed features from the neck. It outputs three sets of predictions corresponding to different scales (P3, P4, P5).

# TODO

## Dataset.py

1. Integrate augmentations from the config file.
   - This will require a more sophisticated transform pipeline, possibly using libraries like albumentations.
   - The `transform` function will need to handle both image and bounding box adjustments.
2. Finalize the target format: Ensure it matches what the YOLOv8 model head expects.
   The current format [class_label, x_center, y_center, width, height] is standard.
3. Add error handling for missing image files more robustly (e.g., pre-filter image_ids).
4. The collate_fn provides targets in a "list" style (concatenated targets with batch index).
   Some loss functions might expect padded targets per image. This is a common format for DETR-like models
   and also works for YOLO as long as the loss function can handle it.
   The alternative is to pad each image's targets to a max_objects count, creating a tensor of
   shape (batch_size, max_objects, 5). For now, the current collate_fn is efficient.To use `pycocotools`, we need to install it. I'll add a step to install it using pip.

## Test.py

1. We'll need a robust NMS implementation, similar to what eval.py needs.
2. from yolov8.some_utils_for_nms import non_max_suppression # Placeholder
3. **Crucial**: Implement proper Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS).
   - Use `torchvision.ops.nms`. This is essential for meaningful output.
   - The current filtering is just by confidence and will show many overlapping boxes.
4. Refine box coordinate scaling: Ensure robust scaling from model's input dimensions
   to the original image dimensions for accurate visualization. (Initial version added)
5. Add support for saving detections in a structured format (e.g., JSON file per image).
6. Consider batch processing if a directory of many images is provided, for efficiency.
   Currently processes one image at a time.
7. If COCO test set evaluation is desired (without labels), adapt COCODataset to load
   test images and use a similar loop, saving results in COCO JSON format for server submission.
   This script is more focused on direct inference and visualization.
8. Ensure `model.head.stride` is correctly handled (similar to eval.py).
9. More robust error handling for image loading/processing.
10. Add option for webcam input ('0').
11. Add option to not save images if only detection data is needed.
12. The class_names from config are used. Ensure they match the model's training.

## Train.py

1.  Implement `ComputeLoss` class. This is critical.
    - It will need to match predictions (output of model.head in training mode) with targets.
    - Calculate classification loss (e.g., BCEWithLogitsLoss).
    - Calculate bounding box regression loss (e.g., CIoU loss).
    - Calculate DFL loss if applicable.
    - Calculate objectness loss (usually part of cls/reg loss components for YOLO).
2.  Implement `validate_epoch` function (or integrate with `eval.py`).
    - This will involve running the model on the validation set and calculating mAP.
3.  Integrate actual data augmentations from the config file into `COCODataset` or the transform pipeline.
4.  Add support for loading pretrained weights.
5.  Add Tensorboard or other logging for metrics.
6.  Refine error handling and add more verbose logging where needed.
